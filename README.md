# Indigenous Australian Materials - Science Project

This interactive website explores the chemistry and traditional uses of indigenous Australian materials, created for Year 8 Science at St Kevin's College (2025).

## Project Overview
This website presents an in-depth look at three significant materials used by Indigenous Australians:
- **Ochre** - Natural earth pigments (Fe₂O₃)
- **Tea Tree Oil** - Natural antiseptic compound from Melaleuca alternifolia
- **Spinifex Resin** - Natural adhesive from Triodia species

## Features
